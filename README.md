# OXO-Game-Tic-Tac-Toe-CSC1011H-Semester-1-2024
This is a networked OXO game built using Python and PyQt5 as part of my CSC1011H coursework in the first semester of 2024. The game includes features like multiplayer support over a network, a graphical user interface, custom instructions, and a play-again option.  I received a relatively good mark for this project.
