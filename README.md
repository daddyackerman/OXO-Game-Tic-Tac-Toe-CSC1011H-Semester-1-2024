OXO-Game-Tic-Tac-Toe-CSC1011H-Semester-1-2024
This is a networked OXO game built using Python and PyQt5 as part of my CSC1011H coursework in the first semester of 2024. The game includes features like multiplayer support over a network, a graphical user interface, custom instructions, and a play-again option.  I received a relatively good mark for this project.

To play the game:

Start the game server first (ensure it's running and accessible).

Then, open the GUI on each device:

If playing across multiple devices, enter the IP address of the machine running the server.

If playing on a single machine, simply use localhost as the server address.
